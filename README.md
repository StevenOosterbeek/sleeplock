Sleeplock
=========

Sleeplock is a system which automatically locks a door when his user lies down on bed. As a result, the user does not need to worry about whether or not he has locked the door - especially useful for single older people.

I am currently developing a prototype with Arduino for testing and proving this system could really work in real life. Components for my prototype are:
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Step motor, 28BYJ-48
- Force sensitive resistor (2)
- LED (2)
- Button
